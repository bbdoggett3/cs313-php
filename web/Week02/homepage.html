	<p>Hey everyone, my name is Benjamin Doggett. I am currently a student here at BYU-Idaho studying software engineer. I was born and raised here in Rexburg Idaho. It's amazing to see how this town has grown. I remember as a kid riding bikes down to, then, Rick College and playing Street Fighter at the arcade that was located where the, now, Manwaring Center stands. It's just surreal to me... Upon returning home from my 2 year mission to Brazil Campinas I reconnected with one of my dear friends from High School and eventually convinced her to remove me from the "friend-zone" and give me a chance. We married soon after, and have never been happier, now enjoying a life of craziness with our 3 beautiful children.</p>
	<p>We made the decision to sell our home in Twin Falls, leave my solid career, and take a leap of faith to jump back into school and turn my hobby of programming into a career.  It was SCARY, but I have loved every door that programming has opened for me while studying at BYU-Idaho. I have had the chance recently to use my artistic abilities along with my programming skills to help design and take part in a variety of creative games and projects. I hope that by taking this class I can grow my skill set in designing front end technologies and grow as a developer. I currently work for Idaho Central Credit Union as an Innovation Tech agent.</p>
	<p>Aside from my family, school, work, and programming I love to be enveloped by a good story weather that is through a book, movie, video game (Destiny Preferably) podcast, you name it! Any form of entertainment if it has a great story I'm all in! I also draw, and love motorcycles. I'm currently in the process of rebuilding a 1978 Yamaha XS500E, and any chance I get I will be found riding one. I also do maintenance and manage an apartment complex with my wife here in Rexburg which keeps us very busy as well.</p>
